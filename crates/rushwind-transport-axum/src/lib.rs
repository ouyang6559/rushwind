//! Axum adapter for the RushWind lifecycle.
//!
//! [`AxumServer`] binds a TCP listener eagerly at construction and serves
//! the supplied [`axum::Router`] inside [`Server::start`]. Eager binding
//! means bind failures surface immediately at the registration site, and
//! that [`Server::endpoint`] reports the actually-bound address — including
//! the OS-assigned port for `:0` binds.
//!
//! # Shutdown mapping
//!
//! axum's graceful-shutdown mode is wired directly to the RushWind stop
//! signal. When the signal fires, axum stops accepting new connections and
//! drains in-flight requests; once the drain completes, [`Server::start`]
//! returns [`ServerError::Cancelled`] per the contract. By the time the
//! orchestrator's stop phase runs, the listener is already closed and there
//! is nothing left to release, so [`Server::stop`] is a no-op returning
//! success.
//!
//! The in-flight drain happens *inside* start, bounded by the orchestrator's
//! drain deadline: a connection that never completes is abandoned together
//! with the start future when that deadline lapses.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Plain HTTP only. TLS termination belongs in a front proxy; if TLS
//! termination inside the process is ever needed, it arrives as a separate
//! adapter rather than a feature of this one.
//!
//! # Session-shutdown bus
//!
//! Routes that carry long-lived sessions (e.g.
//! `rushwind-transport-ws`) cannot see this server's stop signal on their
//! own — axum hands routes an opaque handler closure at assembly time,
//! before any lifecycle exists. [`AxumServer::with_aux_shutdown`] lets
//! such routes register a shutdown bus; when the lifecycle's stop signal
//! fires, this server relays it onto every registered bus so mounted
//! session handlers can wind down cooperatively instead of lingering
//! until the process exits. See `docs/session-middleware.md`.
