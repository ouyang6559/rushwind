## Design philosophy

> **Not a batteries-included framework. A box of bricks.**

RushWind does exactly one thing: **reliable multi-server lifecycle orchestration**. The core defines contracts — a transport trait, a shutdown signal, an instance model — and every concrete protocol stack is a separate adapter crate that the user snaps in as needed. The core contains no logging, no registry, no config center: those are bricks, not the baseplate.

Everything is designed native to Rust's ownership, cancellation and error models; normative details of contract semantics, budgets and shutdown behavior live in [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) (Chinese). The data-access layer extends the same philosophy: the `rushwind-storage` contract — one Repository contract driving many engines — with one adapter crate per engine, pulled in as needed.

## Status

The capability surface is fully landed: **104 crates + 8 examples**, spanning lifecycle orchestration, transport, HTTP, storage, security, config, registry, observability, resilience, cache, messaging, transactions, tasks, encoding, scripts, AI, and object storage. Each domain = one contract crate + an engine matrix pulled in as needed; every engine and adapter must pass the conformance suite — a green `cargo test` is the definition of conformant. Each domain evolves on its own, at the Rust ecosystem's own pace.

Still on the roadmap: kcp (for legacy interop), and a standalone `rushwind-protocols` repo.

## Layout

Grouped by domain. Contract crates presuppose no engine; engines and adapters are pulled in as needed, each passing the conformance suite.

### Core & transport

| Path | Role |
|:---|:---|
| `crates/rushwind-core` | lifecycle orchestration: concurrent start, cascading shutdown, bounded phases, outcome observation |
| `crates/rushwind-transport` | contracts: `Server` trait, `StopSignal`, `Instance`, `ServerError` |
| `crates/rushwind-transport-axum` | axum adapter: serves a `Router` under the lifecycle; shutdown mapping in the architecture doc |

| `crates/rushwind-transport-webtransport` | WebTransport adapter: wtransport endpoint under the lifecycle with the full session chain (HTTP-family gates at session-request time, atomic admission, handshake deadline); `stop()` is a real release |

### HTTP surface

| Path | Role |
|:---|:---|
| `crates/rushwind-http` | the HTTP edge: a gRPC-aligned error envelope `HttpError` — code/reason/message/details with built-in `AuthnError`/`StorageError` conversions; the request middleware stack recovery / request-id / logging / CORS / timeout and the `HttpEdge` assembler; `with_authn` / `with_authorization` bridging the security contracts onto axum routes with the `Authenticated` extractor; feature-gated `/healthz`+`/readyz` and `/metrics` mounts, design in [docs/http-edge.md](./docs/http-edge.md) (Chinese) |
| `crates/rushwind-http-binding` | the proto-HTTP wire contract, parameterized by a caller-supplied descriptor pool: the form binder (dotted paths, both field-name spellings, map/list/oneof structure, the well-known leaf whitelist), Content-Type codec resolution, the pre-auth bind layer, the protojson response codec, the per-route lifecycle tail, and the four-field status error envelope |
| `crates/rushwind-gen-http` | the descriptor-driven code generator for the proto-HTTP route surface: per-binding route tables with form-binding plans, (package, reason) → HTTP status error tables, one service trait per annotated proto service with null placeholder impls, and the public/gated mount emitters |

## Lifecycle

```text
┌─ start: all servers run concurrently ──────────────────┐
│  trigger set: OS signals / internal stop() /            │
│  external signals / any server exiting                  │
└────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                         ▼
   phase 2: before hooks (sequential, each with its own budget)
                         ▼
   phase 3: all Server.stop run concurrently (independent budgets, panic isolation)
                         ▼
   phase 4: after hooks (sequential, each with its own budget)
                         ▼
   endgame: outcome() / subscribe_done() observable from outside
```

Every phase's budget is minted **at the moment that phase begins**, never inherited from an earlier context. A server that ignores the shutdown signal is **dropped** at the drain deadline (Rust's drop is cancellation); a hung `stop()` is cut off by the deadline and recorded as `Timeout`. Normative details in [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) (Chinese).

## For adapter authors

A new transport = implement `Server` + pass the conformance suite. Two things:

```rust
// crates/rushwind-transport-<your-stack>/tests/conformance.rs
rushwind_testkit::rushwind_conformance_suite!(crate::your_server_factory);
```

A storage engine works the same way = implement `Repository` + pass the storage suite:

```rust
// crates/rushwind-storage-<your-engine>/tests/conformance.rs
rushwind_testkit::rushwind_storage_conformance_suite!(crate::fresh_repo);
```

A green `cargo test` is the definition of conformant; CI enforces it for every adapter crate.

## Development gates

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

CI runs the same gates on a Linux/Windows/macOS matrix. The entire workspace is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.

## Security

- A malicious `stop()` cannot wedge the process: every phase has a hard budget
- A panicking server is isolated and recorded; it never skips sibling teardown
- Vulnerability reporting in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md), the threat model in [docs/threat-model.md](./docs/threat-model.md) (Chinese), the authn/authz contract and threat-surface notes in [docs/security-authn-authz.md](./docs/security-authn-authz.md) (Chinese)
